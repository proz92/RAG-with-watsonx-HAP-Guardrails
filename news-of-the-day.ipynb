There are multiple ways to accomplish this in `langchain`, but `ContextualCompressionRetriever` and `load_summarization_chain` is quite straightforward. In this case we're going to use the IBM Granite model within the available Langchain wrapper so to easily integrate it with our summarization chain. Here we limit the summary to snippets related to our topic of choice.\n","\n","In order to use IBM Granite model within watsonx, we will use the environment variables previously set in the notebook."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":31,"id":"626814e1","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["from ibm_watsonx_ai.metanames import GenTextParamsMetaNames as GenParams\n","from ibm_watsonx_ai.foundation_models.utils.enums import DecodingMethods\n","from langchain_ibm import WatsonxLLM\n","\n","granite = WatsonxLLM(\n","    model_id='ibm/granite-13b-chat-v2',\n","    url=credentials[\"url\"],\n","    apikey=credentials[\"apikey\"],\n","    project_id=project_id,\n","    params= {\n","        GenParams.DECODING_METHOD: DecodingMethods.SAMPLE.value,\n","        GenParams.MAX_NEW_TOKENS: 1024,\n","        GenParams.MIN_NEW_TOKENS: 1,\n","        GenParams.TEMPERATURE: 0.5,\n","        GenParams.TOP_K: 50,\n","        GenParams.TOP_P: 1\n","    }\n",")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"747e4925","metadata":{},"source":["Here we compress the found documents by leveraging the LLM again before passing them into the chain for geneating the answer"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":32,"id":"9c612700","metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/Users/mrinalduzzi/Desktop/Projects/RAG-with-watsonx/.venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/langchain/chains/llm.py:316: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain.\n","  warnings.warn(\n","/Users/mrinalduzzi/Desktop/Projects/RAG-with-watsonx/.venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/langchain/chains/llm.py:316: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain.\n","  warnings.warn(\n","/Users/mrinalduzzi/Desktop/Projects/RAG-with-watsonx/.venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/langchain/chains/llm.py:316: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain.\n","  warnings.warn(\n","/Users/mrinalduzzi/Desktop/Projects/RAG-with-watsonx/.venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/langchain/chains/llm.py:316: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain.\n","  warnings.warn(\n"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Document 1: \n","\n","Kyle Larson wins by 0.001 seconds in closest finish in NASCAR Cup Series history\n","\n","By Thomas Schlachter, CNN\n","\n","Updated: \n","        5:54 AM EDT, Mon May 6, 2024\n","\n","Source: CNN\n","\n","Capping off a weekend of photo finishes, Kyle Larson won NASCAR’s AdventHealth 400 by a staggering 0.001 seconds in Kansas on Sunday.\n","\n","Unlike the Kentucky Derby won by Mystik Dan on Saturday, not even the naked eye could separate who finished first out of Larson and eventual second-place finisher Chris Buescher in a photo finish.\n","\n","The finish was so close that Roush Fenway Keselowski Racing (RFK Racing), Buescher’s team, and commentators on the broadcast originally believed Buescher had done enough to secure victory.\n","\n","The RFK team could be seen on the broadcast jubilantly celebrating before the official result was finalized.\n","\n","Eventually, Hendrick Motorsports’ Larson was declared winner in the closest finish in NASCAR Cup Series history, per NASCAR.\n","----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Document 2: \n","\n","Kyle Larson wins by 0.001 seconds in closest finish in NASCAR Cup Series history\n","By Thomas Schlachter, CNN\n","Updated: 5:54 AM EDT, Mon May 6, 2024\n","Source: CNN\n","Capping off a weekend of photo finishes, Kyle Larson won NASCAR’s AdventHealth 400 by a staggering 0.001 seconds in Kansas on Sunday.\n","Unlike the Kentucky Derby won by Mystik Dan on Saturday, not even the naked eye could separate who finished first out of Larson and eventual second-place finisher Chris Buescher in a photo finish.\n","The finish was so close that Roush Fenway Keselowski Racing (RFK Racing), Buescher’s team, and commentators on the broadcast originally believed Buescher had done enough to secure victory.\n","The RFK team could be seen on the broadcast jubilantly celebrating before the official result was finalized.\n","Eventually, Hendrick Motorsports’ Larson was declared winner in the closest finish in NASCAR Cup Series history, per NASCAR.\n","\n","No part of the context is irrelevant to the question.
